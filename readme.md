A project for mobile LED lights written for arduino based on ESP32 (tested with ESP32-Pico, ESP32-S3) that creates a mesh network based on painlessmesh between all devices on the network. Pattern information is shared between nodes and syncronized based on the mesh time. LEDs are controlled via FastLED and tasks through TaskScheduler. Main.cpp hosts the mesh setup and task scheduling, patterns holds all the pattern code, and platformio.ini defines the controllers used.
